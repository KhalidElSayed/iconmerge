= iConMerge

http://mocra.com/projects/iconmerge

Creates a composition image/icon file where the second image becomes a thumbnail overlay on top of the first.

<div class="thumbnail"><a href="http://skitch.com/drnic/bdagi/coming-soon-iconmerge"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20090207-emn72965qpe2xe7kidkc1xesuq.preview.jpg" alt="Coming soon: IconMerge" /></a></div>

The resulting image can be saved as a .icns file or applied directly to a bundle's own icon.

For example, the original purpose was to create project-specific Xcode project icons. The 
Xcode project icon would be the main icon image, and the project's own icon would be the 
thumbnail. That way you could tell what each Xcode project was for by its thumbnail.
